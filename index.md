# CS425-Game-GML

## Information
This game was made in GameMaker Studio 2 for my CS425 final project.
The game was designed to play with BOIDs. The player plays as the main zombie, indicated by the green circle with a "P". The player can collide with human entities, indicated by blue/purple with a certain symbol. Non-aggressive enemies are indicated by a peace symbol, aggressive enemies by a chevron. Colliding with these enemies will turn them into a mob zombie, indicated by an "M". These mobs will follow the player as BOIDs and attempt to collide with any nearby aggressive enemies.
